# Phishing-Incident-Analysis
This project demonstrates core skills in the "Analyze" stage of the Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow. The objective was to methodically triage a suspicious email, reverse-engineer its origination using technical headers, identify social engineering tactics, and produce actionable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for immediate mitigation.
